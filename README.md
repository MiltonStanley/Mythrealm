MYTHREALM
=========

The discovery of time travel has opened the door to travel between eras. The [Portal chamber] located in [capital city] allows movement to different eras, but travel to the past requires stripping to [travel suit] and an empty inventory to prevent timeline contamination. On arrival, timeskippers are issued cheap clothes for that period. 

But over time, gradual changes have still found their way into the timeline...

Gameplay
========

One year in real life translate to transition from one age to another; hence one year after arriving in the tribal era, players will find themselves in the mythological era. Three years after that it's the modern age.

Broader Descriptions
====================

TRIBAL
------
several tribes scattered around continent. deposits of stone and metal, can make stone tools and weapons and such. wear animal skins, maybe cloth later in year. small-scale combat

MYTHOLOGICAL
------------
Small citystates/kingdoms scattered around 1 or 2 continents. Larger armies. Bronze tools. Not necessarily magic, but something similar - "blessings of gods" or something.

IMPERIAL
--------
Is Rome. Iron weaponry, advanced engineering. multiple continents, one massive empire, smaller empires outlying. Contest of poly- and mono- theism

DARK AGES/MEDIEVAL
------------------
Magic. Knights/castles/etc. There is only 1 god- [Monotheistic religion based on Christianity] is dominant religion. Same area as Imperial.

MODERN
------
Is today. One religion is still true but opposition is rising. Entire world. Modern warfare.

NEAR-FUTURE
-----------
United Earth - 1 government on planet. Colonies scattered around. Maybe SOME conflict between colonies & mother. Slllloooow interstellar travel, some sci-fi tech, time-travel close

FUTURE
------
Star Trekky. Time travel discovered! Quite a few aliens (10-20); most united; some enemy alien confederations. Advanced Tech. Somewhat fast travel; money ALMOST irrelevant.

FUTURE 2
--------
Star Wars. Is becoming dystopic. More advanced tech, old alliances have broken, leaving a shattered Federation - which, to prevent more shattering has reorganized into the Empire. Travel is faster but more expensive.

FUTURE 3
--------
Cyberpunk. Empire is only a few places. Syndicates run everything. Travel back to being slow. Pirates constant risk, as are crooked imperial cops. Earth's political placement TBA

THE END
-------
As Future 3 comes closer to ending, players must leave it before year's end. Failure to do so will result in teleportation to random era.
